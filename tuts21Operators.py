# Operators in python
# Arithmetic Operators
# Assignment Operators
# Comparison Operators
# Logical Operators
# Identity Operators
# Membership Operators
# Bitwise Operators

# Arithmetic Operators
# print("5 + 6 is ",5+6)
# print("5 - 6 is ",5-6)
# print("5 * 6 is ",5*6)
# print("5 / 6 is ",5/6)
# print("5 % 6 is ",5%6)
# print("15 // 6 is ",15//6)
# print("5 ** 3 is ",5**3)

# Assignment Operators
# x = 5
# print(x)
# x += 7
# print(x)

# Comparison Operators
# i = 9
# print(i == 5)
# print(i >= 9)
# print(i <= 5)
# print(i < 9)
# print(i > 9)

# Logical Operators
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and a)
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)
# a = False

# Identity Operators  -- is aor is not
# a = True
# b = False
# print(5 is not 5)
# print(5 is not 6)
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)

# Membership Operators  -- in aor not in
# list = [3,4,5,6,1,23,43,32,345]
# print(9 in list)
# print(2 in list)
# print(3 in list)

# Bitwise Operators
# 0 -- 00
# 1 -- 01
# 2 -- 10
# 3 -- 11
# 4 -- 100
# 5 -- 101
# 00 and me 0 aor 0 zero hota hai
# 01
# print(0 & 1) #output 0 hai

# 00  or me ek bhi 1 rhega to output 1 hoga
# 01
# print(0 | 1) #output 1 ayega

# 00 or me ek bhi 1 rhega to output 1 hoga
# 11
print(0 & 2)
print(0 | 3)  #output 3 ayega
